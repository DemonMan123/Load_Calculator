## 🛠️ About the Program

My progam is simply a tool to help with operations, which will include the following:

- ✅ **A calculator which will expand from the left side of the UI.**
- ✅ **startup checklist**
- ✅ **running/monitoring checklist**
- ✅ **Safe shutdown procedures**
- ✅ **A diagnostic tool to help identify and understand common reactor issues and warnings**

> **Note:** This program is a **work in progress**. Nothing is implemented yet, this is just a map of what I'm planning on adding.

> **Note 2:** Yes, I used chatgpt to write this readme file. I'm too lazy to truly write a readme file myself. The program is written by me however, as chatgpt sucks at coding.
